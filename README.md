## Description

The purpose of this project is to visualize census data on linguistic diversity in the United States. To that end, this project uses D3.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating data visualizations on the web. This project does not aim to draw conclusions or analyze the presented data in any meaningful way. The goal is simply to create interesting charts, graphs, and maps that bring the data to life.
